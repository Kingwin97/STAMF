# STAMF
This project provides the code and datasets for 'STAMF: Synergistic Transformer and Mamba Fusion Network for RGB-Polarization based Underwater Salient Object Detection'


Dataset: 
TJUP-USOD and USODP: Baidu Pan：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YjRaEdLTKTAggES3v1ziuA password：mmqw

You can retrain the model by running train_test_eval.py (with the Training parameter set to True), or load our provided weight files and run train_test_eval.py (with the Testing parameter set to True) to obtain the predicted images.

Thank you very much for your attention. We will continue to provide updates...
